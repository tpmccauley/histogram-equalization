## What is this? 
This is a simple application that applies [histogram equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization) to images

## How do I use it?
* Clone this repo, run the command `python -m http.server` and open `localhost:8000` in your browser
* Drag and drop your image into the "original image" frame
* When the image is processed you will see the original image, the normalized image, and the equalized image along with the corresponding image histograms (the lower one is cumulative)
